# Rowe Insurance ### This project includes the following technologies: - HTML - CSS - SASS - Javascript ### Project description: This project was used as an exercise to continue building on my SASS understanding as well as to implement some new CSS psuedo-elements and selectors. I had just completed a few interesting topics regarding CSS and I decided to implement these concepts on a single page design, something that allowed me to implement what I had just learned. I chose a generic idea such as a small insurance web page to give me a clear roadmap of sections to implement in the page. ### What building this project taught me: The project gave me more confidence in utilizing SASS for my CSS, along with working on additional pseudo-elements and selectors which helped me understand the true potential of CSS and what can be achieved without the need for implementation through Javascript. I also decided to challenge myself and without consulting a tutorial, try to implement a changing hero icon to give myself a chance to play around with vanilla Javascript, I can absolutely see that what I wanted to achieve could have been implemented using CSS but I thought I would try anyway.
